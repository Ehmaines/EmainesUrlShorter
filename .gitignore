# Uncomment the line above if you want to ignore development settings by default, 
# though often dev teams commit a template or the dev json itself if it contains no secrets. 
# Given the user context, I will include it but if they have secrets they should be careful.
# Actually standard dotnet ignore strictly ignores user-specific files. 
# I will ignore appsettings.Development.json as it often contains local db strings.
